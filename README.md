This is a Python package that provides a simple class Pushable that creates "pushable" iterators by wrapping an inner iterator/iterable. Pushable iterators act like dynamically expanding queues, allowing you to peek ahead or push items back onto the queue.


## Basic Usage

We can turn any iterable/iterator into a pushable iterator using the constructor.
```
count_up = Pushable( range( 0, 5 ) )
```

We can use it like an ordinary iterator:
```
print( next( count_up ) )
# Prints 0
```

Or we can look-ahead to see what is coming:
```
whats_up_next = count_up.peek()
print( whats_up_next )
# Print 1
print( next( count_up ) )
# Also prints 1 because peek does not remove the item from the internal queue.
```

We can even push back items onto it:
```
count_up.push("cat")
count_up.push("dog")
print( list( count_up ) )
# Prints 'dog', 'cat', 2, 3, 4
```

## Examples

From an iterator such as a file-object, which will iterate over the lines in a file, create a peekable/pushable iterator. This can be useful for example when we want to know if the iterator still has contents or want a sneak peek at what is coming.

```py
from pushable import Pushable

def read_upto_two_blank_lines( filename ):
    with open( filename ) as file:
        plines = Pushable( file )
        # Pushable iterators can be used as booleans in the natural way.
        while plines:
            line = next( plines )
            # peekOr makes it safe to look ahead.
            if line == '\n' and plines.peekOr() == '\n':
                # Two blank lines encountered.
                break
            else:
                yield line        
```

It is also useful to perform "macro-like" transformation.

```py
from pushable import Pushable

def translate( text, translations ):
    ptokens = Pushable( text.split() )
    while ptokens:
        token = next(ptokens)
        if token in translations:
            ptokens.multiPush( *translations[token].split() )
        else:
            yield token

print( ' '.join( translate( 'My name is MYNAME', {'MYNAME':'Fred Bloggs'} ) ) ) 
# Prints: My name is Fred Bloggs
```

### More Complex Uses

In addition to peeking and popping items, which risks raising a
`StopIteration` exception if there's nothing left on the internal queue, we
can utilise `peekOr` and `popOr` to deliver a default value instead. The 
default value is passed as an optional parameter and falls back to None.

We can also peek and pop multiple values using `multiPeekOr` and `multiPopOr`, 
which return generators. These support skipping over values so that you can
get the 2nd and 3rd value without getting the first e.g.

```py
(second, third) = Pushable("pqr").multiPop(skip=1, count=2)
print( second, third )
# Prints: q r
```

Lastly, we can push multiple items with `multiPush`:
```py
count_up.multiPush("cat", "dog", "rabbit")
count_up.push("dog")
print( list( count_up ) )
# Prints: ['cat', 'dog', 'rabbit']
```
